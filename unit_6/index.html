                    <p>"Where there is clutter, even valuable things lose their value. Where there is too much, nothing stands out."</p>
                    <p>The essence of Japanese aesthetic is a concept called 'MA' (pronounced "maah") — the pure, and indeed essential, void between all "things."
                    A total lack of clutter, MA is like a holder within which things can exist, stand out and have meaning. MA is the emptiness full of possibilities, like a promise yet to be fulfilled.</p>
                    <p class="pull">"Look at it this way: When you feel there is too much clutter, it is not because you have too many things; it is rather because you don't have enough MA."</p>
                    <p>The presence of MA makes the minimalism of a Japanese tatami room so serene. However, minimalism is limited to physical form and space, where MA is not.
                    MA in essence is what makes minimalism possible. MA is in the purposeful pauses in speech which make words stand out. It is in the quiet time we all need to make our busy lives meaningful, and in the silence between the notes which make the music.
                    MA is what creates the peace of mind (called 'heijoshin' in Japanese) we all need, so that there is room for our thoughts to exist properly, and to thrive. Artists understand the importance of "negative space" which surrounds an object in a image. Its use can have a dramatic impact on the mood and tone of the finished work.
                    MA takes the concept of negative space farther, to define a continuum which spans both space and time.</p>

                    <p class="pull">"In our busy lives, it is easy to feel there is not enough time to do everything properly. However, no matter how little time we can devote to any task, it has to have a deliberate beginning and a deliberate end, albeit short."</p> 
                    <p>Otherwise, our time goes by filled with one thing after another, like an essay with a lot of words — without complete sentences, paragraphs, commas and periods.</p>

                    <h2>Shinrin-yoku</h2>   
                    <p>Shinrin-yoku is a term that means "taking in the forest atmosphere" or "forest bathing." It was developed in Japan during the 1980s and has become a cornerstone of preventive health care and healing in Japanese medicine. Researchers primarily in Japan and South Korea have established a robust body of scientific literature on the health benefits of spending time under the canopy of a living forest. Now their research is helping to establish shinrin-yoku and forest therapy throughout the world.</p>

                    <p class="pull">"The idea is simple: if a person simply visits a natural area and walks in a relaxed way there are calming, rejuvenating and restorative benefits to be achieved."</p>

                    <p>We have always known this intuitively. But in the past several decades there have been many scientific studies that are demonstrating the mechanisms behind the healing effects of simply being in wild and natural areas. (some of this research is available here). For example, many trees give off organic compounds that support our “NK” (natural killer) cells that are part of our immune system's way of fighting cancer.</p>
                    <br>
                    
                    <ol><h6>The scientifically-proven benefits of Shinrin-yoku include:</h6>

                        <li>Boosted immune system functioning, with an increase in the count of the body's Natural Killer (NK) cells.</li>
                        <li>Reduced blood pressure</li>
                        <li>Reduced stress</li>
                        <li>Improved mood</li>
                        <li>Increased ability to focus, even in children with ADHD</li>
                        <li>Accelerated recovery from surgery or illness</li>
                        <li>Increased energy level</li>
                        <li>Improved sleep</li> </ol>
                    <br>
                    <ol><h6>Just as impressive are the results that we are experiencing as we make this part of our regular practice:</h6>

                        <li>Deeper and clearer intuition</li>
                        <li>Increased flow of energy</li>
                        <li>Increased capacity to communicate with the land and its species</li>
                        <li>Increased flow of eros/life force</li>
                        <li>Deepening of friendships</li>
                        <li>Overall increase in sense of happiness</li> </ol>
                    <br>
                    <p>We recognize that forest therapy approaches such as Shinrin-yoku have roots in many cultures throughout history. John Muir wrote, “Thousands of tired, nerve-shaken, over-civilized people are beginning to find out that going to the mountains is going home. Wilderness is a necessity.” He is one of many people who we include when we think about the origins of the practice.</p>
                    <p class="pull">"Go to a Forest. Walk slowly. Breathe. Open all your senses.</p>
                    <p>This is the healing way of Shinrin-yoku Forest Therapy, the medicine of simply being in the forest."</p>

                    <h2>Go Look at a Tree</h2>          
                    <p>Even in the city or indoors, noticing nature increases general happiness and well-being, according to research. It’s no secret that Mother Nature has all kinds of feel-good mojo to offer, with a lot of research backing it up beyond what most of us instinctively know. Which is wonderful for those with woodlands at hand or a beach within reach, but what about us poor city slickers?</p>
                        
                    <p>As it turns out, even those of us living in the urban hubbub can take advantage of nature’s glee-giving generosity – all we have to do is take a little time to, basically, stop and smell the roses.University of British Columbia (UBC) researcher Holli-Anne Passmore says if people simply take time to ponder the nature around them, it will increase their general happiness and well-being. Passmore, from UBC’s Okanagan campus, just published research looking at the connection between observing nature and personal well-being. The conclusions are encouraging.</p>

                    <p>The study had one group of people document how bits of nature in their day-to-day made them feel. And the definition of nature was generous – anything not human-built, a houseplant, a dandelion growing in a crack in a sidewalk, birds, or sun through a window, explains Passmore. The subjects took a photo of the item that caught their eye and write a short note about how it made them feel. Another group in the study did the same with human-made objects; a control group did neither. In total, there were 395 participants. Passmore, whose academic field is wellness, found not only the more than 2,500 photos and descriptions of emotions submitted “overwhelming,” but also that the simple act of observing emotional responses to nearby nature had such an impact on personal well-being.
                        “The difference in participants’ well-being – their happiness, sense of elevation, and their level of connectedness to other people, not just nature – was significantly higher than participants in the group noticing how human-built objects made them feel and the control group,” Passmore says.</p>

                    <p class="pull">“This wasn’t about spending hours outdoors or going for long walks in the wilderness,” she adds. “This is about the tree at a bus stop in the middle of a city and the positive effect that one tree can have on people.”</p>

                    <p>So if you can, go ahead and do your forest bathing ... but if all you have is a dandelion in a sidewalk crack, look at it, think about how it makes you feel and don't be surprised if you notice your spirits lift.</p>

                    <p>The study was published in the Journal of Positive Psychology.</p>
